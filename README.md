# 🌟 Deep Playground Plus: a Project of MLS club SupCom 🚀

Deep Playground Plus is an enhanced version of Deep playground, an interactive visualization of neural networks written in TypeScript using d3.js. We've added a new exciting feature that allows users to change the input of the neural network based on their preferences! 🎨🧠

We use GitHub issues to track new requests and bugs. Your feedback is highly appreciated! If you'd like to contribute, be sure to review the contribution guidelines. 📝👀

## Development 🛠️

To run the visualization locally, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run build` to compile the app and place it in the `dist/` directory.
3. Run `npm run serve` to serve from the `dist/` directory and open a page on your browser.
4. For a fast edit-refresh cycle when developing, run `npm run serve-watch`. This will start an HTTP server and automatically recompile the TypeScript, HTML, and CSS files whenever they change. 🔄

## For Owners 💼

To push to production, use the command: `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`. 🚀
